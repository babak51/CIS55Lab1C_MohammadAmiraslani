This app will allow the user to enter two pieces of information 
- the starting pay in cents on day 1 and the number of days to calculate the pay for.  
It will also allow the user to press a button called 'Calculate'.  
Pressing the button will then output the daily pay and total pay per day by doubling 
the pay entered and will only output for the number of days entered.
